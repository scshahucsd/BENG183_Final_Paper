## ChIP-Seq - Identify Protein Interactions

The genome is very long and complex. Only a small fraction of the genome is actually functional. We need a method for determining the important, functional components from the non-functional segments. The regions that are important usually have proteins that interact with the DNA. This could be Transcription Factors binding to promote or supress a nearby gene or Histones raveling or unraveling the chromosome. To study this, we use the the powerful tools: ChIP-Seq. We will go through the steps of ChIP-Seq to see how this assay method can help us determine where proteins interact with the genome:

** Steps: **
* Crosslink DNA and Protein
* Sonicate to Shear the DNA
* Add Protein Specific Antibodies
* Immunoprecipitate
* Reverse Crosslink
* Purify DNA
* Sequence and Map DNA Fragments
